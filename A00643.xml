            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Reverend Authour of this book was a Miniſter very conſcientious, and one that had a great abilitie given him by God to preach unto and work upon the conſciences of people, to awaken the ſleepie conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to inform the erroneous conſcience, to ſettle the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:2082:7"/> conſcience, and to comfort the wounded conſcience: his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were all dipt in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And therefore a ſubject of Conſcience muſt needs be welcome from ſuch a preacher. It is true that this birth is <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humum opus,</hi> and cometh out after the death of the Authour: But I hope it will be the more pleaſing, to revive the memory of him whoſe life and labours were deſervedly pretious in the eſteem of Gods people. And if conſcience, though for a while blind, and dumbe, and ſeared, and put out of all office, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:2082:7"/> at laſt be put into office, and made to ſee, ſpeak and feel to the utter deſtruction of an impenitent ſinner; why may not a diſcourſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though long ago preached, be ſuffered to revive and live for the ſalvation of thoſe that ſhall have grace to reade it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right? eſpecially conſidering that theſe ſermons were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by himſelf in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time?</p>
            <p>Much I could ſay in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this worthie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, both in regard of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariſome pains in preaching,

            <p n="1">1. By our outward and inward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I do not ſay, by our outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For a man may be in the ſtate of hypocriſie, and yet his outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be good. Neither do I ſay by our inward actions alone: For a man may be in the ſtate of ſelf-deceit, and yet ſay his heart is good and his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mind good. But I ſay, by them both put together. Our Saviour ſetteth it out by a tree;<note place="margin">

               <hi>Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit: but a corrupt tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p n="2">2. Ye may know what eſtates ye are in by your inclinations and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from whence theſe actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112.</note> Are your hearts inclined heaven-ward and God-ward, as Davids? are ye bent to holineſſe and ſelf-deniall, &amp;c. as a bow is bent to ſhoot the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? This is a ſigne of a good eſtate: as 1. Chron. 22.19. there is ſpeech of <hi>ſetting the heart to ſeek God.</hi> Ye know when a man will do a thing indeed, we ſay <hi>he is ſet on't.</hi> It may be ye do ſome good duties, make ſome fair offers of ſeeking God; but are your hearts ſet on't? or are they ſet on the world and inclined earth-ward? The inclinations of every creature in the world do ever

            <p n="3">3. One may know what eſtate he is in by that reflexive act which is proper onely to man. There is an act in mans ſoul (we call it a <hi>reflex</hi> act) which no creature hath but onely man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he can perceive what himſelf is and doeth. When a man thinketh or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he can reflect upon himſelf and perceive what he thinketh or ſpeaketh: when he prayeth, he can reflect upon his own heart, and perceive how it carrieth it ſelf all along in his prayers. I ſay, no creature in the world hath in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</note> This is the reaſon why ſome know not what eſtate they are in, becauſe they choke their own ſpirit and hoodwink their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.

               <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Ye may know what eſtate ye are in by a certain kind of feeling. As there is a kind of bodily feeling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every man knoweth the eſtate of his body whether he be ſick or in health, ſo there is a ſpirituall feeling.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32.</note> The two diſciples did feel their hearts burn: Paul did feel a great combat in him between the fleſh and the ſpirit:<note place="margin">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2082:24"/> they cannot feel how bad it is: But for the moſt, they may eaſily feel what their eſtate is.</p>
            <p>The third uſe is,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe <hi>3.</hi> Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to ſhew you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments that hinder this knowledge. If you would attein to know what eſtate you are in, then remove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments; which are</p>
            <p n="1">1. Vain thoughts. Men who are in a ſtate of ſin and wrath, yet have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vain thoughts lodging within them keeping them from knowing it: <hi>God is mercifull;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt died for ſinners;</hi> and, <hi>There be worſe ſinners then they; why ſhould they think ſo ill of themſelves?</hi> and, <hi>they may be better all in good time:</hi> Theſe vain thoughts hoodwink their eyes that they cannot ſee their eſtate, nor reſolve that it is ſo dangerous as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is. <hi>O Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>waſh thy heart from wickedneſſe: how long ſhall theſe vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> They were in a very bad eſtate; and yet they had ſuch vain thoughts that they could not ſee it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Preſumption is another impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Men pray, and heare, and do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2082:25"/> other good duties, and ſo take all to be well without ſerious examining. This was the caſe of the Laodicean people: They thought they had that in them which they had not,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.</note> and that their eſtate was good, when it was nothing ſo.</p>
            <p>Another let are the Cares of this life: Whereby the heart is ſo occupied that it doth not find time to ſearch its own eſtate. Therefore our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.</note>

            <p n="4">4. Another let is an Evil conſcience: which affrighteth a man ſo ſoon as he beginneth to ſtirre, and maketh him afraid to go on to look ſoundly into his eſtate.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Another let is Ignorance. <hi>There is none that underſtandeth, none that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after God.</hi> Mark; they did not ſeek in what caſe they ſtood before God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not underſtand.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2082:44"/> thing. 2. Becauſe we break a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the loyns of a ſinne, when we go againſt conſcience. Ajax light upon a beaſt and ſlew it: his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience thought verily it was a man; <hi>Kill it not,</hi> ſaith conſcience, <hi>it is a man:</hi> he goeth againſt his conſcience and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it. His conſcience here was in an errour, yet he as truly guilty of murder before God as if he had indeed ſlain a man, becauſe he ſlew a man through the loyns of this beaſt: His bloudy mind looked at a man, and ſmote at a man, and ſlew a man. So when conſcience is erroneous, and thinketh this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God; it is not ſo, but he thinketh it ſo in his conſcience; if he do contrary he breaketh a commandment though it be none, becauſe the errour of his conſcience made it one to him. Was not Herod truly guilty of the murder of Chriſt? He thought in his conſcience that Chriſt had been among the infants ſlain at Bethlehem. Thus conſcience is a ſovereigne thing: It is alwayes a ſinne to go againſt it, erre or not erre: and if it be a ſinne to go againſt

So when one doubteth whether it be a ſinne not to call his familie together every day to prayer; Gods miniſters tell him he muſt or he ſinneth: <hi>I doubt of that,</hi> ſaith he. Do you ſo? but you are ſure it is no ſinne to do it: Therefore you are bound to do it, becauſe you are bound to decline the doubtfull part and take that which is certain.

When conſcience doubteth on both ſides which is the ſinne and which not, then a man ought to do that which is moſt void of offenſe. As for example; Say an Anabaptiſt amongſt us doubteth whether it be a ſinne in him to bring his child to church to be baptized, or a ſinne to refuſe; here his rule is, That that which is moſt void of offenſe, and moſt agreeable to brotherly unity and concord, is to be taken, the balance hanging otherwiſe even; and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2082:45"/> to urge both the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeming of like weight, then this muſt be put into the ſcale and reſolve the doubt.</p>

For we muſt conſider there are two kinds of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: there is a ſpeculative doubting, and there is a practicall doubting. Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive doubting is to doubt of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thing it ſelf to be done: Practicall doubting is to doubt of the lawfulneſſe of the doing of it. Now this latter is not alwayes a ſinne, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is: As for example; If a ſervant be commanded of his maſter to attend on him on the Lords day, he knoweth not what his buſineſſe ſhould be, and perhaps doubteth it is not of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to be done on that day; yet he hath no reaſon to deny his attendance: in this caſe though he doubt of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the thing done, yet he need not doubt of the doing of it, becauſe he knoweth not what the buſineſſe is, and hath no reaſon whereby he is able to

A friend that knoweth but little can give but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle counſel. Again, give heed evermore to the counſel of conſcience. You know Achitophel took it ill that his counſel was not followed; therefore he made away himſelf in diſpleaſure: So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will take it very ill if its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be not followed: it will ſtrangle it ſelf, and ſmother it ſelf; you ſhall hear no more of it. Eſpecially take heed you do not reject conſcience, nor offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to it: If you do, you will make it unfaithfull and remiſſe; and then you loſe the beſt means under heaven of your good: Then deadneſſe of ſpirit ſucceedeth, and hardneſſe of heart ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth place, and you deprive your ſouls of all poſſibility of cure. As long as a ſick man hath any poſſibility of cure he is ſtill under hope; but if ever he loſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2082:54"/> that he is gone: Conſcience is the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of the ſoul to amendment; and therefore if you dull conſcience, and make conſcience remiſſe and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, you take the ready way to deprive your ſelves of all poſſibility of riſing again.

His ſinnes lay heavie upon his conſcience for a fit. Hezekiah one while ſeemed not to have it: <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterneſſe.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay the children of God have it not alwayes. But let me tell you; They might have it alwayes. 1. It is poſſible they ſhould have it alwayes: Their ſinnes of ignorance and infirmitie do not break the peace of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: cannot; for if they could, then no man ſhould have true peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at any time. Nothing but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and witting ſins, ſinnes againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can break the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: &amp; as it is poſſible for the children of God to live without theſe, ſo it is poſſible for them alwaies to have peace; yea, they may have dayly more and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2082:71"/> more peace. 2. As it is poſſible for the children of God alwayes to have peace, ſo they are commanded to keep their peace alwayes; and it is their own fault if at any time they loſe it:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Job</hi> 22.21.</note>

If the children of God have it not alwayes, then they feel the want of it: and in the want of that comfort nothing elſe will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them. It is not all the peace and proſperitie of the world that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their hearts as long as they have not this peace; not all the mirth in the world can content them untill they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this peace again, the peace and

The godly alwayes have the ſeeds of it in them: <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous,</hi>

As it is with the wicked; they may ſeem now and then to have true peace, but they have the ſeeds of horrour alwayes in them, which will ſprout forth at laſt, and then they ſhall find the worm of an evil conſcience again: ſo on the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2082:72"/> contrarie ſide, the godly may ſeem now and then to have no peace, but yet they have alwayes the ſeeds of true peace in them, which will in time ſhew themſelves and ſolace their ſouls for ever. 5. They never want peace as the wicked do want it: The wicked want it, and have no poſſibilitie of having it: they go in ſuch <hi>paths</hi> as wherein they ſhall never <hi>know peace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                     <p>A quiet good conſcience is ſuch a marvellous bleſſing that it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be but we muſt like it and wiſh, <hi>O that we had it.</hi> Let us then examine our ſelves and ſee whether we have it or no.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2082:81"/> a man who hath it can never look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another mans comfort, but a good conſcience will ſay, <hi>Yea, and I have my comfort too.</hi> When Paul was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Timothie, ſee how his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpake of himſelf at the ſame time:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10.</note>

                        <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſt! yea, ſweeter then hony unto my mouth.</hi> A good conſcience maketh a man taſt ſweetneſſe in prayer, when his conſcience telleth him he prayeth aright: It maketh him taſt ſweetneſſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2082:81"/> in a Sabbath, when his conſcience tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him he ſanctifieth it aright: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſacrament, when his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can witneſſe he receiveth aright. What is the reaſon ſo few of you taſt ſweetneſſe in theſe things? The reaſon is this; Becauſe ye have not the peace of a good conſcience: It would find ſweetneſſe in every good dutie, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good word and work.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A good quiet conſcience maketh a man taſt ſweetneſſe in all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, in meat, in drink, in ſleep, in the companie of friends: it putteth a <hi>Better</hi> upon a very <hi>morſel,</hi> Prov. 17.1. Brown bread and a good conſcience, there is a <hi>Better</hi> upon it then upon all the coſtly fare of the wealthie without it. Bernard calleth a good conſcience <hi>a ſoft pillow:</hi> An other calleth it <hi>a dear boſome-friend:</hi> Solomon calleth it <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feaſt.</hi> It maketh a man taſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in every outward thing. The healthy man onely can take pleaſure in recreations, walks, meats, ſports, and the like: they yield no comfort to thoſe that are bedrid or ſick, or half-dead:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2082:82"/> But when the conſcience is at peace, the ſoul is all in good health; and ſo all things are enjoyed with ſweetneſſe and comfort.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It ſweetneth evils to a man, as troubles, croſſes, ſorrows, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. If a man have true peace in his conſcience, it comforteth him in them all. When things abroad do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet us, how comfortable is it to have ſomething at home to chear us? ſo when troubles and afflictions without turmoil and vex us and adde ſorrow to ſorrow, then to have peace within, the peace of conſcience, to allay all and quiet all, what a happineſſe is this? When ſickneſſe and death cometh, what will a good conſcience be worth then? Sure more then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.

                     <p>Again, you who have a peaceable conſcience, 1. Labour to maintein it. Be often in communion with God, be not ſtrangers to him the light of whoſe countenance is the peace of your ſouls. It is the walking with God that breedeth true peace and preſerveth it.

We muſt take heed we do not trouble nor diſquiet it, that we do not reſiſt it, or offer violence unto it by committing ſinne againſt the peace of it, but endeavour to maintein the peace of it by obeying the voyce of it. Get the fear of God, which is wiſdome; and to depart from evil, which is true underſtanding: <hi>All her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. We cannot walk in any one path of true wiſedome but we ſhall find in it peace: There is peace in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and peace in charity, and peace

The very having of it will teach you the worth of it, and learn you to priſe it, and make you above all things unwilling to leave it. And thus much of the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a quiet conſcience.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The cauſes of it are theſe five. 1. The guilt of ſinne: When a man hath done evil, and his conſcience doth know it, then doth the conſcience crie guiltie:<note place="margin">

                        </gap> the world, who promiſe themſelves that all ſhall be well with them: but yet there be deſpairers too, and very many, whoſe conſciences are troubled
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2082:88"/> with ſecret deſpair; though it may be not apparently to others.</p>
                     <p>Now the cauſes of theſe deſpairing conſciences are theſe. 1. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne; when the heart thinketh ſecretly thus, <hi>Certainly the Lord cannot find in his heart to forgive me.</hi> As it was with Cain: When he had lived in earthly-mindedneſſe, and then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and then in diſcontent and in hatred, and then in hardneſſe of heart, the Lord rebuked him, and yet his heart was ſo hard that ſtill he went on in evil; then he murdered his brother; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he deſpaireth;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13.</note> 
                        <hi>My ſinnes are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> ſaith his conſcience, <hi>then can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi> He thought God could not find in his heart to forgive him. So when men ſinne and ſinne, and the Lord doth rebuke them, and yet they do ſinne, and their conſciences do check them, and yet they go on, at laſt they come to have ſecret deſpairs in their heart, that God now will not look towards them; whereas if yet they had a mind to ſtoop to Jeſus Chriſt, they might be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 2. A ſecond cauſe of deſpairing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2082:89"/> is multitude of temptations. Indeed the godly ſhould not be ſo apt to think themſelves forſaken of God by reaſon of temptations as ſometimes they are; they ſhould rather <hi>count it joy,</hi> as James ſpeaketh, chap. 1.2. But yet many of the wicked deſpair finally by this means: Becauſe they do ſo often fall into temptations, therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are forſaken of God. 3. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Gods word. When the guiltineſſe of ſin meeteth with minds not inſtructed in the doctrine of free grace and reconciliation by Chriſt, this is a cauſe of deſpair. 4. So alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured cuſtome of ſinning is another cauſe. When men are often quickned, and grow dead again; then quickned again for a fit, and then hardned again: in the end they fall to deſpair. Theſe and the like are the cauſes of deſpairing conſciences. And thus I have ſhewed alſo the ſecond thing propounded to be handled, namely, the ſundry degrees of troubled conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third thing is the difference between the troubled conſcience in the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2082:89"/> godly and in the wicked. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Gods children may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and are many times; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the wicked they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled too: now the queſtion is, How do they differ? I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That trouble in the conſcience of wicked men is accompanied with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, and ſometimes with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: <hi>I would I were able to reſiſt God,</hi> ſaith Francis Spira: like thoſe in the Revelation who <hi>blaſphemed God becauſe of their torments.</hi> Sometimes it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with curſings, as Iſai 8.21. ſometimes with infinite murmuring. But in Gods children it is not ſo: When their conſcience is troubled, they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie God, and clear God, and give him the glory of all, and ſubmit under his hand, and ſubdue their hearts unto him: as David in his trouble did not fret and murmure againſt God, but ſaith he, <hi>If God have no pleaſure in me, lo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26.</note> 
                        <hi>here I am: let him do with me what ſeemeth him good.</hi> So that the trouble of conſcience in the children of God and in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doth much differ in this firſt reſpect</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2082:90"/>
                     <p n="2">2. The trouble of conſcience in the wicked ariſeth onely from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods wrath and fear of judgement for ſinne, not for the ſinne it ſelf and from the love of holineſſe: But that in Gods children ariſeth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſinne, and the want of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods love unto them: <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> Pſal. 13.1. Mark whence the trouble of the Pſalmiſt came: This was his trouble, that God did hide his face.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Trouble of conſcience in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked never maketh them part with ſinne, never breedeth a hatred of ſin in them; but that in Gods children doth. True it is that a wicked mans troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may make him vomit up his ſin, like a dog that vomiteth up his trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat: but he doth not vomit up his ſtomach to that meat; for when the trouble is over he returneth to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit again. So a carnall man returneth to his deadneſſe of heart again, and to his ſecuritie again, when the trouble is over. Pharaoh, whileſt his conſcience
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2082:90"/> was troubled at the ſenſe of Gods judgements, O then ſaith he, <hi>I have ſinned: I pray, Moſes, let me have your prayers; and I will let you go.</hi> If the children of Iſrael could have packed up and departed while this trouble had laſted, they might have been gone. But <hi>when he ſaw there was reſpite,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15</note> 
                        <hi>he hardned his heart again.</hi> Mark; His trouble of conſcience did not make him part with his ſinne: But that in Gods children doth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That in the wicked driveth them from God: They have little heart to come unto him: They ſee nothing but wrath; and they rather go about to ſeek eaſe in other things then to ſeek his favour: as Saul ſought eaſe in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and Cain in building caſtles and cities, and Judas in a deſperate courſe. Their trouble fetcheth them not to God. But the trouble in Gods children worketh otherwiſe: In the midſt of trouble of conſcience they reſt upon God: as Heman crieth,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.1.</note> 
                        <hi>O Lord God of my ſalvation,</hi> in the midſt of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his ſoul. The eyes of Gods
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2082:91"/> children are ſtill towards heaven; they think ſtill they ſhould have ſome help from God: They pray and cry, and though God ſeemeth to neglect them, yet they cannot give over: They will not be beaten off from waiting on God when he will ſpeak comfort to them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That trouble that is in the wicked maketh their heart ſullen: but that in the godly melteth their heart: <hi>My ſoul is like melting wax,</hi> ſaith David in his troubles of conſcience. His ſoul melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, and was even poured out before him, Pſal. 22.13. This is a kindly working. Thus ye ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

It is the greateſt miſery that can be: it is even a hell to men here upon earth: it is like a diſmall ghoſt to terrifie the ſoul: it is like a burning furnace in the boſome: it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the life bitter.

Some have born agues, fevers, ſtones, colicks, convulſions, rackings, torturings: as long as a mans ſpirit is ſound he is able to bear any of them, all of them: <hi>but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Never was there man that was able to bear a wounded ſpirit. We may ſee by many of Gods children how heavy it is: David <hi>rored with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> of it: a ſtrange phraſe. He man was ready even to runne out of his wits with it: <hi>While I ſuffer thy terrours,</hi> ſaith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If it be thus with Gods children, what may we think of the wicked? If we could ſearch into the boſomes of ſome wicked men who are enemies to God, then we might ſee and underſtand
<pb facs="tcp:2082:92"/> the true weight and burden of this troubled conſcience. Cain crieth out of <hi>more then he can bear.</hi> Judas thought to find more eaſe in hell then in his own heart: So terrible was the torture of his troubled conſcience, that he murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, thinking verily that hell could not be worſe.</p>

I beſeech you, conſider, ye who yet abide in your ſinfull eſtates and are yet in the fleſh: I beſeech you, conſider what the event will one day be.

<pb facs="tcp:2082:94"/> at the laſt, and then wo be to you. Your conſciences will make all things grievous and bitter to you, even thoſe things which in themſelves are moſt ſweet and good: When ye heare of heaven, of mercie, of the bloud of Chriſt, theſe will but encreaſe your miſerie: conſcience will ſay, <hi>You have no part in them.</hi> When you heare the word, any promiſe or comfortable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in it, your conſcience will ſay, <hi>Yea, this is my miſerie, I have no ſhare in theſe things.</hi> This will be a hell unto you, and will torment you before your time.

I beſeech you, brethren, conſider theſe things, you that have not felt a troubled conſcience untill this houre. Ye hardly know yet what it is: ye will know it to your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if you do not conſider it. There is a phraſe in Ezek. 30.24. where God ſaith he will make Pharaoh <hi>grone with the gronings of a man deadly wounded:</hi> So it will be with you, if you will not hearken and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt: conſcience will make you grone with fearfull grones; <hi>O wo is me, I am undone, without hope, without remedie.</hi> Conſider this therefore, and be wiſe, before the things which concern your peace be hidden from you.</p>
                  <p>And let me the rather exhort<note place="margin">Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> you to this in regard of the danger of the times. The Lords wrath is gone out, and his judgements do flie through the earth, and his plagues do fall on every ſide of us: What will your guiltie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences

When troubles and afflictions are without, then how grievous is it to want peace and comfort within? When Gods mortall arrows are in your bodies, then to have the arrow of his wrath ſticking in your ſouls, this will adde ſorrow to ſorrow, and make your eſtate much more uncomfortable and unſupportable. Beloved, peace of conſcience is good at all times; but it is moſt precious when calamities fall on us: Then to have the peace of a good conſcience that may bring us good news from heaven, that all is well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, all peace there, this is ſuch peace as all the world cannot give nor ſell nor buy.

                     <p>I begin with the firſt: Suppoſe a man have peace of conſcience, what muſt he do to keep and maintein it? I anſwer,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We muſt labour to prevent troubles of conſcience by taking heed that we do nothing contrarie to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We muſt not be drawn by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or credit, or the love of any luſt, to do that which conſcience forbiddeth. Nothing ſhould be ſo dear unto us as the peace of conſcience: nothing for the love of it ſhould make us do ought againſt our conſcience. How miſerable
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2082:97"/> are thoſe comforts, delights, ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we get to our ſelves in ſuch courſes as our own hearts do condemn! However they ſeem comforts for a while, and contentments for a while, and delights for a while, yet at laſt it will appear that miſerable comforts are they all. Nothing that we get in any evil way will chear and comfort us in a time of need. What ſaid Francis Spira at the time of his death, when ſeeing his wife and children about him, and thinking on the goods and eſtate which he had got for them by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth which he had before mainteined againſt the Romiſh errours, he cried out in the horrour of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>How terrible is the ſight of theſe unto me!</hi> However before they had been comforts to him, yet now he could not endure the ſight of them. <hi>O,</hi> thought he, <hi>I recanted for your ſake; I yielded to ſuperſtition, and it was long of you:</hi> Therefore he abhorred now the ſight of them. Wretched is he that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth himſelf in any courſe which his conſcience findeth fault with. It is a

So that if we have peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and deſire to maintein it, let us never allow our ſelves in any courſe that our conſcience may condemne us in.

                        <hi>II. Queſtion;</hi> How the peace of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth depend upon our care and our obedience.</head>
                     <p>The reaſon why I raiſe this queſtion is this, Becauſe as our juſtification is onely in Chriſt, ſo our peace is onely in him; how then doth the peace of our conſcience depend on obedience? The place of ſcripture that occaſioneth the doubt is, 1. Pet. 3.21. <hi>The anſwer of a good conſcience towards God by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is by Chriſt; how dependeth it then on our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A good conſcience doth not depend upon our obedience as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe of it, but upon juſtification which we have by Chriſt if we be in him: Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ye ſee then that our peace is grounded upon our juſtification as the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2082:100"/> principall cauſe of it. If we ſhould ſeek for peace from our works and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, alas, they are ſinfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; there is no peace to be found in them: Our conſcience would be troubled at our beſt duties, at our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in prayer, our frailties in hearing, our ſlips in every holy ſervice: There is nothing we do but our conſcience might find fault with it, and pick a hole in it; and therefore we had need to flie unto Chriſt for true peace. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that Papiſts have not true peace, but profeſſedly ſay that every man muſt doubt, and no man can be ſure of his ſalvation. They muſt needs doubt indeed who truſt to their own works: which can never bring true peace. The conſcience muſt ever be quarrelling and finding of fault, and be without peace, if we truſt to the beſt works. So that this is the firſt anſwer, All true peace dependeth upon juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith in Chriſt as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We anſwer, That our peace dependeth upon our obedience
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2082:100"/> in this ſort, that we can have no peace except we be given to obedience. Thoſe men that can ſinne and yet be at peace, were never juſtified in their lives. A child of God when he ſinneth; as for example, if he ſhould be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie, or to omit a good dutie, which he knoweth he is bound to perform; yet this would much trouble his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; his ſoul would be aſhamed, his heart perplexed, he would not know how to look the Lord in the face; <hi>I have ſinned: what ſhall I do unto hee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> When Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid had ſinned againſt God,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>and I go mourning all the day long.</hi> And therefore peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth depend thus farre on obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as that a man cannot have peace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nleſſe he be obedient, and take heed of ſinne, and labour in all things to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight before God. Now if you ask me, But how doth our peace depend upon our obedience? I anſwer,<note place="margin">Dub. Sol.</note> It dependeth upon obedience as the removing cauſe: It removeth that which would hinder our peace. Sinne would interrupt our
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2082:101"/> peace: now obedience removeth ſinne. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1. John 3.18, 19. <hi>My little children, let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth: For hereby we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before God:</hi> Hereby we ſhall aſſure our conſciences that we are in him, if we take heed of hypocriſie: If we love in truth, and be obedient in truth, we ſhall thereby remove all our doubts and our fears, our troubles and perplexities of conſcience. So that peace doth depend on obedience as the removing cauſe: It removeth that which otherwiſe would hinder peace. This is the firſt. Again, our peace of conſcience dependeth upon our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the witneſſing cauſe of it. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is one of the witneſſes of true peace; it witneſſeth that we have peace with God.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
                        <hi>This is our rejoycing, even the teſtimonie of our conſcience, that in ſimplicitie and godly ſinceritie we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> See here, it is the witneſſing cauſe of it: Paul had peace of conſcience; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2082:101"/> was able to make him rejoyce: How? Becauſe it gave teſtimony that his converſation was godly and ſimple and gracious. Though we be in Chriſt, yet we can have no peace unleſſe holy obedience doth witneſſe the ſame. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is not the cauſe of the peace of our conſciences before God, but it is the cauſe of our perceiving the ſame: We know we have peace by reaſon of our obedience:<note place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 2.29.</note> We know that <hi>every one that doeth righteouſneſſe is born of God: We know we are paſſed from death to life,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 3.14. 1. <hi>John</hi> 4.13.</note> 
                        <hi>becauſe we love the brethren: Hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us, by the ſpirit that he hath given us.</hi> Mark; we come to know it by obedience and by the fruits of obedience. Take away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, we can never know peace. <hi>They that walk by this rule,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16.</note> 
                        <hi>peace ſhall be upon them and upon the Iſrael of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Thirdly, our peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience dependeth on our obedience as the confirming cauſe: Chriſt confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our peace to us by making us walk cloſe to him and obedient unto him. Paul ſheweth how it preſerveth peace,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2082:102"/> as a ſhoe preſerveth the foot: ye know if we ſhould walk without ſhoes, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, our feet would be in danger of pricking and hurting. So doth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel preſerve our peace: <hi>Stand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.15.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>having your feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace.</hi> Mark; he compareth it to a ſhoe, which he would have us ſhod with; and then it will be the Goſpel of peace to us, and our peace ſhall be in ſafety. Fourthly, our peace depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon our obedience, not onely as a ſigne of true peace, nor onely as a guard to it, but as a thing pleaſing to God, without the which we diſpleaſe God. For though God be pleaſed with his children alwayes in Chriſt, yet he is not pleaſed that any in Chriſt ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to him.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye have received of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> how ye ought to walk and to pleaſe God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. When Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren walk in obedience, that is pleaſing unto God. So that peace of conſcience doth greatly depend on obedience: For otherwiſe conſcience will be troubled; <hi>O I do not pleaſe God; This is diſpleaſing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2082:102"/> unto God;</hi> and, <hi>This doth provoke God.</hi> Not as though there were any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in our obedience that can ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any tittle of Gods law; but becauſe when our perſons are pleaſing to God in Jeſus Chriſt, then our obedience to God is pleaſing too in Jeſus Chriſt, and conſcience will ſay it. Thus much ſhall ſuffice for anſwer to the ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon of this queſtion is this; Becauſe it ſhould ſeem there is no ſuch obedience in this life as any peace of conſcience ſhould depend on. Doth not James ſay, <hi>In many things we ſinne all?</hi> Doth not our Saviour ſay, <hi>When ye have done all that ye can, ſay, We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants.?</hi> If our conſcience can ſtill ſay that we are unprofitable, and that we do ſinne in every thing that we do, yea in many things, in all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we go about; if our conſciences can ſay thus, How can any peace depend
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2082:103"/> upon obedience? What obedience do you mean that peace of conſcience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1. Abſolute perfection in obedience is not required unto evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall peace. For if it were, no man could have peace; no not Paul, nor Abraham, nor any of the holieſt of Gods children: and therefore abſolute perfection is not required. <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned, we make Chriſt a liar, and his word is not in us,</hi> 1. John 1.10. Our conſcience can ſtill ſay we have ſinned; and it can ſtill ſay our obedience is imperfect: A halting leg can never go perfectly. A Jacob is called he that halteth; and every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul halteth: Though he do not halt between two, as wicked people do, yet he halteth in following after God. What purblind eye can ſee perfectly? or thick eare heare perfectly? He that hath theſe imperfections of body can neither go nor ſee nor heare perfectly: So the beſt of Gods children have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of heart and ſpirit and mind: their faith is imperfect, their love is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and therefore their obedience
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2082:103"/> muſt needs be imperfect. But abſolute perfection is not required to true peace of conſcience; and therefore this doth not hinder it. 2. Though abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be not required to peace, yet ſuch obedience is required as may be acceptable to God. So ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.</note> 
                        <hi>We labour that whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we may be accepted of him.</hi> Such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we muſt ſhew as may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, or we cannot have true peace. If our endevours be not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our conſcience will quickly heare of it, and tell us ſo: If we pray coldly, or heare unprofitably, or live looſely, if we do not do that which is acceptable to God, our conſciences will ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Nay though we do do the duties, if we do not do them in an acceptable manner, conſcience will have matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us ſtill. 3. This acceptableneſſe of obedience lieth in this, when our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is ſincere, univerſall, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and proceeding from the ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus dwelling in us. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle giveth it this phraſe, <hi>When we walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:2082:104"/> Rom. 8.4. That is our fulfilling the law, when Chriſt hath fulfilled the law for us, and maketh us ſincerely to walk by it, not after the fleſh but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: when we do not favour our ſelves in one luſt, nor ſuffer our ſelves in any beloved ſinne; but whatever it be that is evil, our conſcience can ſay we truly do hate it and labour to avoid it; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that is commanded us, be it never ſo contrary to our nature, yet our conſcience can ſay we ſincerely ſet our ſelves to do it. So walking not after the fleſh but after the Spirit, this is ſincerity of obedience, and this is required unto peace. 4. This ſincerity of obedience maketh us to bewail our very infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to be humbled for them: not onely to be humbled for greater ſinnes, but alſo to be humbled for our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If we be not ſoundly humbled for our very infirmities alſo, they will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace of our conſcience: We can have no peace except our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can witneſſe that our infirmities do humble us and drive us to Chriſt and cauſe us to ſue out a pardon. If conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                        <hi>IV. Queſtion;</hi> How if a man have a burdened and troubled conſcience, what muſt he do to be freed from it?</head>
                     <p>The reaſon of this queſtion is this; Becauſe men are ignorant about it. When men are troubled in conſcience and burdened a little that way, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they daub all with peace, and go a wrong way to work. This courſe the Lord doth complain of in the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who preached too much peace; <hi>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, peace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.11.</note> 
                        <hi>when there is no peace.</hi> And ſo they do more hurt then good: Like a chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that skinneth the wound before he giveth ſearching ſalves to kill the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it: afterwards it breaketh out
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2082:105"/> worſe, and it is a hundred to one but it will coſt the patient his life: So it is with many men: A man cannot rore a little for his ſinnes, <hi>I have been a ſinner, and what ſhall I do? I have been a beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. But, <hi>O,</hi> ſay they, <hi>believe man, Chriſt died for thee, and the promiſe is to thee, and God will pardon thee.</hi> Thus they heal him ſlightly with <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> and it may be there is no peace to him yet; he had need to be ſearched more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they skinne the wound, and it is a thouſand to one but it loſeth the mans ſoul, by giving a cordiall where a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive was neceſſarie. And therefore great reaſon that this queſtion ſhould be anſwered, If a man have a burdened troubled conſcience, what muſt ſuch a man do to be freed from it?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1. Let him take heed that he meddle not too much with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will of God, what his decree and purpoſe is from eternitie. As ſoon as an arrow is ſhot into the conſcience, &amp; the conſcience cometh to be humbled, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the heart layeth about it, <hi>And how if God have reprobated me? and what
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2082:105"/> if he have appointed me to wrath? how then?</hi> Beloved, ye muſt take heed of this: If your hearts faſten upon repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, that will marre all; that will quite diſcourage a poore ſoul from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Underſtand the word right. Do not think that becauſe God hath not in particular named thee, therefore he hath excluded thee. Gods promiſes are made in generall to all that believe; and they are to be applyed in particular to all them that believe: why then ſhouldſt thou exclude thy ſelf when God doth not exclude thee? Wouldſt thou have Chriſt? Chriſt to juſtifie thee? Chriſt to ſanctifie thee? Chriſt to rule thee? Wouldſt thou be under Chriſts regiment, and live at his will? Come and welcome: no ſoul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.</note> 
                        <hi>let him take of the water of life freely.</hi> Ye ſee there is a <hi>Quicunque vult,</hi> Whoſoever will. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if thou haſt not a will to be in Chriſt; but thou wilt do thus and thus, and thou wilt have thy will, and this luſt, and that friend, and ſuch a courſe,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2082:106"/> and, <hi>Tuſh, this is too ſtrict;</hi> nay, if you be there thou art not for Chriſt: I have nothing for thee but hell and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if thou wouldſt have Chriſt indeed, and be in Chriſt indeed, thy heart in Chriſt, thy will in Chriſt, thy whole ſelf in Chriſt; then ariſe, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thee. Thus underſtand the word right, the goſpel doth not exclude thee whoſoever thou art.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thou muſt not for fear of ſhame or loſſe, &amp;c. keep from reſtitution whereſoever thou haſt done wrong, or ſatisfaction whereſoever thou haſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened, or reformation whereſoever thou art accuſtomed to any evil, or the doing any thing that may procure eaſe and quiet to thy conſcience. It may be one is troubled in conſcience for his wronging his neighbour in twentie pounds, and if he would make reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he might have ſound peace: but he will not; no, he daubeth up his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſome other way. Another it may be ſuffereth diſorders in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and foul abuſes, which if he would redreſſe he might have peace: but he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2082:106"/> will not. Another, if he would down with his pride, another, if he would be acquainted with Gods ſervants, or if he would take any pains in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, be more diligent for the work of repentance, &amp;c. but theſe things will not be done: Men plaiſter up their conſciences (I know not how) ſome other way, and ſo go to hell for not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the right way. But if any of you be troubled in conſcience, keep back nothing, hold back nothing that may make for your true peace and quiet.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thou muſt wait on God: Caſt thy ſelf at his feet, humbly deſire him to give thee the true peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But wait Gods leiſure, knowing thou haſt deſerved to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it: and thus doing thou ſhalt find it to thy great comfort at laſt.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are all they that wait for him;</hi> that is, when the Lord will be mercifull. He will do it with judgement, he will do it when it may do thee the moſt good, when it may bring himſelf moſt glorie: therefore it is fit thou ſhouldſt wait for his time of comforting. Now becauſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2082:107"/> many do miſconſtrue this waiting Gods leiſure, (As for example, one is dead to all good duties, <hi>O,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I wait the Lords leiſure till he quicken me: My heart is much hardned,</hi> ſaith another; <hi>but I wait the Lords leiſure till he be pleaſed to ſoften it.</hi> Thus men are lazie in the mean while; and yet they think they wait the Lords leiſure. O beloved, this is not the waiting the Lord mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; this will not ſtay conſcience; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is guiltie for all this waiting) therefore I beſeech you conſider what waiting I mean. 1. <hi>Wait upon the Lord, and keep his way;</hi> thou doſt not wait elſe, unleſſe thou keep praying, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and meditating, and enquiring, and watching thine own heart leſt it ſhould ſlip aſide. 2. Thou muſt wait as a ſervant waiteth upon his maſter: If his maſter calleth, he cometh; if he ſendeth, he goeth; if he beckeneth, he taketh notice:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2.</note> So thou muſt wait. <hi>As ſervants wait upon their maſters, ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord till he have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon us.</hi> Be obedient in the mean time: go when he ſendeth; come when
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2082:107"/> he calleth; obſerve when he becken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; be diligent to be doing his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 3. Thou muſt wait onely upon God, not upon thy luſts too, and upon other things too; but thou muſt wait onely upon God: <hi>My ſoul, wait thou onely upon God,</hi> ſaith David, Pſal. 62.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>5. If thou wait upon any thing elſe, this is not to wait upon God. One waiteth a time to be revenged; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waiteth a time to ſatisfie this or that luſt: this is not to wait upon God at all. 4. Take heed of healing thy ſelf, and comforting thy ſelf, or daubing up thy conſcience thy ſelf: If thou doſt ſo, thou doſt not wait upon God to do it: If thou doſt it thy ſelf, and ſnatcheſt at comfort thy ſelf before he do give it, then thou doſt not wait till he give it. Suppoſe a man hath done thee an injurie; the Lord he will right thee if thou wilt wait: but if thou go and recompenſe evil for evil, and right thy ſelf, thou doſt not wait upon God, as Solomon adviſeth,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22.</note> 
                        <hi>Say not thou, I will recompenſe evil; but wait on the Lord, and he will ſave thee.</hi> Mark;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2082:108"/> thou muſt not ſave thy ſelf, thine own credit, &amp;c. by revenging, but wait on God for all. So here if thy conſcience be troubled, thou muſt wait upon God to comfort it: If thou goeſt and daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt up the matter thy ſelf, and crieſt, <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> to thy ſelf, thou doſt not wait upon God. Thus I have anſwered the laſt queſtion, How if a man have a burdened and troubled conſcience, what muſt ſuch a man do to be freed from it? And hitherto we have ſpoken of the two laſt adjuncts of conſcience, a Quiet conſcience, and an Unquiet conſcience; What they be, and, How they differ: and we have reſolved and anſwered the queſtions and difficulties about them.</p>

                     </gap>o this. I will inſtance in ſome ſorts of men. 1. The Jews, who contented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Another inſtance we have in the Scribes and Phariſees: When they would have condemned the woman taken in adultery, their own conſcience was privy that they were ſinners themſelves, John 18.9.

                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon is taken from the equity of Gods judgements on the wicked. The Lord he will judge none to hell, but his conſcience ſhall confeſſe he was one that walked in the way to hell and death. Ye may reade it in the man that had not on the wedding-garment: When Chriſt did charge him with his not having on a wedding-garment, and did condemn him to utter darkneſſe, the text ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12.</note> 
                     <hi>he was ſpeechleſſe;</hi> that is, his conſcience confeſſed that Chriſts judgement was juſt: <hi>I have not on a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment,</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:2082:110"/> ſaith his conſcience; <hi>and it is my fault that I have none; and I am rightly condemned.</hi> Thus his conſcience did know it; otherwiſe he could not have been ſpeechleſſe in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe. As Feſtus told Agrippa that he anſwered the Prieſts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 25.16.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not the manner of the Romanes to deliver any man to dye before that he who is accuſed have his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers face to face, and have licence to anſwer for himſelf concerning the crime laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him:</hi> So may I ſay, that the great Judge of quick and dead will not judge any man to hell but he will have his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers face to face, and if he can anſwer for himſelf he may. Now if conſcience be not privy to what eſtate ſoever a wicked man is in, his conſcience could never accuſe him face to face at the laſt day, nor juſtifie the Lord Jeſus, and make the ſinner ſtand ſpeechleſſe before God. He might anſwer, <hi>Lord, I do not know any ſuch thing as is laid to my charge: I am not convinced that the caſe is thus and thus with me, that I am in ſuch an eſtate as I am accuſed of.</hi> No wicked man ſhall be able to ſay thus: Therefore conſcience

                  <p n="3">3. The third reaſon is taken from the Lords manner of judging the godly. He will judge them and abſolve them <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm allegata &amp; probata,</hi> as we ſay, according to the word and their own conſciences. Ye may ſee the true form of judgement which the Lord will go by Matth: 25. Where the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the whole world who were righteous and who not, who to be judged to puniſhment and who to life for ever; at laſt he concludeth, <hi>The wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but the righteous into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Your conſciences can ſay ye are wicked: ye did not feed, nor clothe, nor viſit me: Go your wayes to hell.</hi> So for the righteous: <hi>Your conſciences can ſay ye are righteous: Go ye to heaven.</hi> Thus the Lord will do. Now this could not be if conſcience could not inform every one that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he is ſo: If conſcience could not witneſſe what eſtate they are in, this could not be.

Becauſe conſcience hath a very good judgement. It is a very wiſe and judicious facultie in the ſoul of man. Some make it an act of judgement. We do not take it ſo: It is not an act of judgement, but it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive facultie of the ſoul having a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good judgement. <hi>Whether it be right to obey you rather then God, judge ye,</hi> ſaith Peter, Acts 4.19. appealing to their own conſciences to judge in the point. So that conſcience is a facultie of a good judgement. Now if it be judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, it muſt needs be able to reaſon
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2082:113"/> and to argue about our eſtates, and find out whether they be good or no. It is the judgement of man that is able to argue, and able to hold an argument: <hi>We thus judge,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that if one died for all, then are all dead,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.14. Mark; His propoſition he would prove was, <hi>That all the believers in Chriſt are dead to themſelves and alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> Now ye may ſee how his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maketh here an argument; <hi>If Chriſt died for them all, then they are all dead: but Chriſt died for them all: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all dead.</hi> Judgement is able to make arguments: and therefore if conſcience be a reflexive facultie that hath a very good judgement, it muſt needs be able to frame arguments, and ſo make out what our eſtates are. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is naturall logick in every mans conſcience: It can frame ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes, thus, <hi>As many as be led by the ſpirit of God, are the ſonnes of God,</hi> ſaith the word: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith a godly mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>I am led by Gods ſpirit, and I am carefull to follow the leading of Gods holy ſpirit: therefore I am one of Gods ſonnes.</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:2082:114"/> And ſo on the other ſide. Ye will ſay, How can a countrey-mans conſcience make ſyllogiſmes?

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2082:119"/> as that they are in ſuch a courſe as wherein God will not love them. Nay, they cannot endure that others ſhould diſcover their hearts unto them: They had as lieve they ſhould ſhew them the pit of hell as ſhew them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They look to ſome common gifts and graces that are in them, ſuch gifts and graces as may be in a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but they will not think ſo; as illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, knowledge, the gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of temperance, &amp;c. Theſe they look to, and theſe they ſpeak of, though they have reigning luſts within in their hearts: As Jehu; <hi>Come, ſee my zeal,</hi> ſaith he, 2. Kings 10.16. He doth not ſay, <hi>Come, ſee my pride and hypocriſie;</hi> but, <hi>my zeal.</hi> Jehu looked at his zeal, and ſo thought he was right. So on the contrarie, weak Chriſtians may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times look onely at their ſinnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and take no notice of Gods graces that are in them, and ſo may miſtake their own ſelves, and conclude amiſſe of their eſtates. Thus I have ſhewed you the reaſons why men are miſtaken about their eſtates. Now I
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2082:119"/> will ſhew you the reaſons why men are miſtaken though conſcience do tell them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſpeeches of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the wicked many times, yea moſt times, are low ſpeeches. The gnawings of conſcience whereby they are told they are in a bad and a damned eſtate are like the gnawings of a very little worm that a man can hardly feel. <hi>Where their worm dieth not:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24.</note> The word in the originall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifieth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little worm that breedeth in ſcarlet, that a man can very hardly ſee or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: ſo men ſometimes do hardly ſee or perceive the condemning and gnawing of conſcience. Again, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence biteth ſuddenly, as I told you; it giveth a little nip, and away: Like a ſparrow that flieth by; it flieth ſo faſt by a mans eye that he can ſcarce tell whether it be a ſparrow or no: So it is not eaſily perceived whether it be a condemning conſcience or no: it giveth ſuch ſudden nips, and away, that men ſeldome take notice. Beloved, there is never a wicked man under heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2082:120"/> he be delivered up abſolutely to a reprobate ſenſe, but hath a thouſand of theſe ſudden momentany nips every day in the yeare. Had he the heart to obſerve them: (but he hath not) he might ſee his wretched eſtate, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him, and provoke him to Chriſt, and to be converted that God might heal him; I ſay, had he a heart he might ſee it: but theſe nips are ſo ſecret and ſudden that he doth not. So likewiſe it is with the godly in regard of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: Their conſcience ſuddenly flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in comfort, and they many times do not obſerve it. As Job ſpeaketh of God, <hi>Lo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 9.11.</note> 
                     <hi>he goeth by me, and I ſee him not: he paſſeth on alſo, and I perceive him not:</hi> So doth the Lord go by his children in the ſudden flaſhes of comfort in their conſcience, but many times they ſee him not, perceive him not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the devil blindeth mens eyes, therefore they do not ſee what their conſciences do ſhew them. Ye may reade this of the wicked people in Corinth:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul ſaith he <hi>commended himſelf and the Goſpel to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

But mark what followeth: Some did not ſee this: Why? <hi>The god of this world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath blinded their eyes.</hi> So the god of this world blindeth the eyes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that what their conſciences ſhew them they do not ſee it nor obſerve it. So for Gods people; Though they be in a good and a bleſſed eſtate, and their conſciences can ſay it, yet Satan often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hindreth them that they do not perceive their own comfort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men do not love conſcience. We ſhould love conſcience better then the deareſt friend we have under heaven. We would do much for a friends ſake: but we ſhould do a thouſand times more for conſcience ſake:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.</note> Obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates for conſcience ſake: ſuffer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, reproches, any thing, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2082:121"/> ſake. It is better then all the friends in the world. But the wicked they do not love conſcience: let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeak, they care not to heare it. They will heare friends, but they will not heare conſcience. Let their luſts call, and their profits and pleaſures call for this and that thing, they heare all: but they love not to heare conſcience. Nay, many wicked men are angry to heare talk of it. When Paul had made mention of conſcience, Ananias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he ſhould be ſmitten:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1.</note>

He was angry to heare him talk of a good conſcience. This is moſt certain; men do not love conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor to be curbed by conſcience, nor informed by conſcience: They had as lieve ſee the devil as that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhould inform them of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and tell them thus and thus they are. They are told rightly, and yet they are miſtaken, becauſe they do not love to heare conſcience of that theme.</p>

The naturall goodneſſe of conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in thoſe reliques of goodneſſe which it reteineth ſince the creation. Ye know man depraved and corrupted his conſcience by his fall: yet there be ſome reliques left, as reaſon, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and reflexion. I do not mean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of any ſpiritual goodneſſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: For as there is no ſpirituall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2082:122"/> goodneſſe left in the other faculties of the ſoul, ſo neither in conſcience. But the naturall goodneſſe which I mean is nothing elſe but the veracity of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby it is inforced according to the knowledge it hath to tell the truth. Thus every wicked man hath a good conſcience: Their conſcience is good in that ſenſe; their conſcience hath this naturall goodneſſe, that it telleth them the truth how it is with them. Nay, it is eſſentiall to conſcience to be good in this ſenſe. It is the eſſentiall property of conſcience to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its knowledge. It is the beſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty a wicked man hath: it is better then his mind, or heart, or will.

                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">An infirm conſcience</note>II. Secondly, There is a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience renewed but not ſoundly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, very much as yet defective and imperfect. The former conſcience is called <hi>conſcientia firma,</hi> a firm conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: This is called <hi>conſcientia infirma,</hi> an infirm conſcience. Rom. 15.1. <hi>We that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.</hi> This infirm conſcience is a good conſcience too, and renewed, but cumbred with ſundry imperfections; which in proceſſe of time by growth in grace are, for the moſt part, conquered in the godly. True faith is required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this: For the Apoſtle calleth ſuch an one <hi>a brother in Chriſt,</hi> one that hath this infirm conſcience:<note place="margin">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2082:126"/> ſuch an one a Chriſtian brother, and not to be ſet at nought: and therefore this is a good conſcience too, differing as much as white from black from ſuch conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as are weak through ſuperſtition of mind and through pride of heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not be otherwiſe, or through affected ignorance becauſe they love not to be better informed. Theſe weak conſciences are wicked; I ſpeak not of theſe: I ſpeak of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a conſcience renewed, but renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed imperfectly, having yet ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections. The imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Imperfection of knowledge. It doth not yet ſoundly and clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is lawfull and what is pure, and what is by Chriſtian liberty indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14.</note> 
                     <hi>I know and am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf: but to him that eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing to be unclean, to him it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi> He ſpeaketh of things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: The Apoſtle had knowledge: but there were others who did not know this; <hi>O I may not eat this meat; I
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2082:127"/> may not play at bowls, or uſe any other recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: I ſhould ſinne if I ſhould,</hi> &amp;c. This is one weakneſſe in this kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, weakneſſe of knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond imperfection is to be grieved where it needeth not be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: As when it ſeeth other do that which it ſelf through miſtake doth judge to be evil, it is apt to be grieved and troubled to ſee it;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15.</note> 
                     <hi>If thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably.</hi> It may be thou thinkeſt it lawfull to eat ſuch meat; but he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwiſe, and ſo is grieved to ſee thee eat. This is another imperfection in this conſcience, to be grieved and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended without juſt cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third imperfection is in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It is apt to judge and condemn another mans liberty: 1. Cor. 10.29. <hi>Why is my liberty judged of another mans conſcience?</hi> He ſpeaketh of a weak conſcience. <hi>It is apt to be judging and condemning my liberty,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>but why ſo?</hi> This is a fault and an imperfection indeed; <hi>O ſuch an one ſinneth, he doeth ſo and ſo:</hi> yet it may be the thing is not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2082:127"/> unlawfull, but a weak conſcience is apt ſo to judge it, and to condemn him that doeth it. <hi>Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth,</hi> Rom. 14.3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth imperfection is this: A weak conſcience is apt to be misled. So the Apoſtle intimateth; <hi>Take heed leſt by any means this liberty of yours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſtumbling-block unto them that are weak: for if any man ſee thee who haſt knowledge ſit at meat in the idoles temple, ſhall not the conſcience of him that is weak be emboldned to eat thoſe things which are offered to idoles? and through thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11.</note> Where ye ſee that weak conſciences are apt to be misled. The reaſon is this, Becauſe when they ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom they know to be more learned and judicious then themſelves to do ſo and ſo, that may ſoon tempt them to do it though their conſcience be againſt it.</p>

Let me tell you; It is a ſinne to be wicked how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and the high-way to hell: but to be wicked when ye have godly neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about you, your ſinne now is double: For as you offend God, ſo you offend them too.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2082:129"/> make us with quietneſſe and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit undergo whatever it ſhall pleaſe God to lay upon us. How can they want comfort that have this? It is a ſpring of comfort within them. This will remain with us when all other comforts will forſake us: When friends fail, and eſtate faileth, when credit and health and ſtrength and all fail, then a good conſcience, if we have it, will ſpeak peace to us, yea and it will effect it in us, comfort us, and faſten comfort upon us. Friends may ſpeak words of comfort and peace to us; but it may be we are not able to receive it: the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may preach peace; but it may be we are not able to take it: But a good conſcience ſpeaketh peace and effecteth it; it doth not onely ſpeak it but it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it into our hearts. It proppeth us up in all miſeries, in ſickneſſes, yea in death it ſelf. A good conſcience then maketh us hold up our heads when all the world ſhall be confounded: A good conſcience will bear us out againſt the King of terrours: It is onely a good conſcience that can look death in the

This will make us happie in all our diſtreſſes: When croſſes pelt us, and ſickneſſe paineth us, and death attacheth us, we are happie men. What if we have the tokens of Gods wrath upon our bodies ſo we have the marks of his love upon our ſouls? What outward calamitie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happeneth to us, yet if we have this good conſcience we are happie. O then let us labour to get it by faith and a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. If we would be ſafe in the floud-time, in the day of Gods wrath, we muſt be buſie now about the ark, we muſt provide beforehand for it: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this ark will ſave us in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Gods anger. It is in vain to trouble our ſelves about other things:

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.20.</note> he made pipes and organes: Jabal built tents; others planted vineyards: but Noah provided his ark.

Be they what they will be, in never ſo much credit and eſteem, they are yet moſt miſerable when troubles and afflictions come on them, as one day they ſhall and ſhall not tarrie; then all their comforts will forſake them: When death looketh them in the face, then their hearts die within them. How full of pride and haughtineſſe ſoever they were before, yet when they come to die, if their conſciences be awaked, they will with Saul fall down to heare the name of death,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.20.</note> and no ſpirits be left in them.

               <p n="2">2. Now the ſecondarie or relative bond of conſcience is, when others who have authoritie from God bind conſcience to this or that. I call this a relative bond, becauſe it is onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the authoritie of God. For though men cannot challenge any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or omiſſions contrarie to their law to be ſinnes, yet if they have authoritie from God to command any thing, then they become beams and parts of Gods law, and do by vertue of that bind a mans conſcience.</p>
               <p>This relative bond of conſcience is twofold. Firſt, other men may bind our conſciences; as magiſtrates, and maſters, and parents: who though they cannot bind conſcience as they are men, yet when they have authoritie
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2082:132"/> from God, their commands have Gods ſeals upon them, and do bind, I ſay, in relation to Gods law, which biddeth us obey them; Rom. 13.5. <hi>Ye muſt needs be ſubject, not onely for wrath but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> The Apoſtle there ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Magiſtrates; and he telleth us that their laws bind our conſciences in relation to Gods, and therefore we muſt be ſubject unto them for conſcience ſake. Thus others may bind our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Secondly, we our ſelves may bind our own conſciences; and that is by vows which we make unto God, or by our promiſes which we lawfully make unto men. The vows which we freely make unto God, theſe bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to keep them: Numb. 30.4. the vow of a woman is called <hi>the bond wherewith ſhe hath bound her ſoul.</hi> Mark; ſhe bindeth her ſoul and her conſcience with it. So the promiſes which we lawfully make unto men, theſe alſo bind conſcience: For though before we promiſe it was in our own power, yet when we have promiſed we have bound our own conſciences to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2082:133"/> becauſe there is Gods ſeal upon it; Gods law commandeth us to be true of our words. Theſe are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bonds, bonds onely in relation to Gods law: Gods law is ſtill the ſupreme bond of conſcience. I will handle that firſt.</p>

Nay, conſcience is called <hi>Gods law:</hi> For it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.</note> that <hi>when the Gentiles which have not the law do the things conteined in the law, they having not the law are a law unto themſelves:</hi> that is, Their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Gods law unto them.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2082:135"/> Gods books wherein his laws are to be written. And therefore if it be a ſinne to adde a new law in the materiall book to bind men, then it muſt needs be a ſinne for any creature to put a new law into conſcience, which is the ſpirituall book of God. It is God onely who can write laws in this book: his book is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the laws in the world; and none but God can put in and put out: and therefore none but he can bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. I ſpeak ſtill of this abſolute, &amp; ſupreme bond of conſcience: For Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may bind relatively; but not as they are their laws, but by the law of God before made.

It is eaſie to ſee what miniſterie affecteth moſt and doeth the moſt good in the hearts of the people, namely that which bringeth the cleareſt voice of Gods Spirit calling to obedience and binding the conſcience. They can heare with eaſe and great pleaſure the ſermons of thoſe whoſe doctrines are ſtuffed with humane diſcourſes. Learning and policie never pierce conſcience. Nay,

Then this teacheth us to have an eye to Gods word in that which we do, if we would ſatisfie conſcience. I ſay, have an eye to Gods word: not onely to do that which it may be is in Gods word; conſcience counteth that to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but to have an eye to Gods word. Conſcience will not be ſatisfied with any obedience that we do if we have not an eye to Gods word. Whatever we have an eye to beſides, conſcience knoweth it is nothing, if in all we have not an eye to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: Though we do obey it, conſcience looketh upon it as if we did not obey it. It is onely Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and authority that bindeth conſcience: and therefore nothing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2082:137"/> conſcience unleſſe we have an eye unto that. If we do not aim at Gods will in doing what we do, conſcience counteth our obedience as no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all. As for example; Ye that are husbands, ye love your wives: but is it becauſe God commandeth it? It may be ye love them becauſe they love you, or becauſe your affections are to them: Alas, this is nothing: Pagans and reprobates can do ſo. But do ye aim at the doing of Gods will, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you? O ſay you, <hi>The Lord doth command me, and I do it.</hi> What of that? Do ye look at his commandment when ye do it? If not; be humbled, and know ye muſt get grace to do ſo, or ye are not obedient to God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will conſcience ſet it down for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Ye that are ſervants, ye ſerve your maſters: but do ye aim at Gods will? thus, <hi>O the Lord hath commanded me to be faithfull and painfull in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> Doth your ſoul look to this? It may be ye ſerve them becauſe they are kind, and becauſe they pay you your wages, and the like: This is nothing to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2082:138"/> conſcience: conſcience looketh at the commandment of God; and if your ſouls do not aim at the commandment of God, it wil not ſatisfie conſcience. Ye that are neighbours, it may be ye love one another, and be friends one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: but doth your ſoul look at Gods commandment? is it becauſe God hath commanded us to love one another? People ſeldome aim at God in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: They are friends with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: why? Their neighbours are friends with them. But they do not trouble their thoughts to aim at Gods commandment in it. Let me tell you; Conſcience will not count this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For conſcience feeleth no bond but Gods word: and if ye do not look at that, it is no obedience with conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; conſcience will never acquit you or abſolve you for this; it account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this obedience as no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience at all. See 1. Cor. 10.25. and ſo forward. There the Apoſtle hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that queſtion of conſcience, at laſt concludeth, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2082:138"/> God,</hi> verſ. 31. Let your hearts look at that, and aim at that; in whatſoever ye do ſtill look at God: all is loſt with conſcience elſe. Though ye eat never ſo ſoberly, and drink never ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, pray never ſo duly, conſcience counteth it all nothing if ye do not look at God: It is God onely &amp; his word that doth bind it; and it will never give a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge except your hearts look at him.</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2082:139"/> the ceremoniall law, becauſe it ended in Chriſt. Secondly, the conſcience of the regenerate is freed from ſeeking ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the deeds of the law. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the firſt covenant was by the works of the law; <hi>He that doeth them ſhall live in them:</hi> But the ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpeaketh better things; <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is true, if God had not ſent his Sonne, we muſt have ſought juſtification by the works of the law: Though it were impoſſible to find it by reaſon of our ſinnes, yet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was bound that way. But now that Chriſt Jeſus hath ſealed up a new covenant in his own bloud, conſcience is freed from that former: Rom. 3.28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith without the deeds of the law.</hi> For though juſtifying faith never be without the ſincere doing of the law, yet the deeds of the law have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into juſtification: Conſcience is freed from ſeeking juſtification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Thirdly, the conſcience of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is freed from the rigour of the law. They are bound in conſcience to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2082:139"/> uſe the law as a rule of their life, and in ſinceritie to obey it; but are not bound by the goſpel to the rigour of it: that they are freed from;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</note> and ſo they <hi>are not under the law but under grace.</hi> I grant that all carnall people, who are yet out of Chriſt, do all lie under the rigour of the law: and as long as they ſubmit not to Jeſus Chriſt, nor get into him, they are bound in conſcience to keep it, though they cannot: They cannot ſinne in one tittle, but conſcience will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them before God. They ſhall be condemned for every vain thought, for every idle word, for every the leaſt ſinne, for every the leaſt luſt, for any the leaſt omiſſion of good. They lie under the rigour of the law, and they are bound in conſcience to keep it, and they ſhall be countable for every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, becauſe they are under the law. But the conſcience of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is free from this rigour, becauſe they are under grace, and therefore they are <hi>delivered from the law:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</note> The Lord hath delivered them by the body of Chriſt; and therefore they are not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2082:140"/> bound by the goſpel to all that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the law in rigour requireth. Fourthly, the conſcience of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is freed from the curſe of the morall law. For though the law doth condemn, yet their conſcience needeth not fear it, becauſe they are in Chriſt: <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>

It may be now for the preſent their conſcience is quiet, and they choke it, and ſo it letteth them alone: yet they are condemned in conſcience, and one day they ſhall find it.

See Luke 1.72. <hi>To remember his holy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the oath that he ſware that he would give us, That being delivered out of the hands of our enemies we might ſerve him without fear in holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before him all the dayes of our life.</hi> Mark; Sincere and univerſall obedience is a condition of the covenant of grace, not onely for a manifeſtation to our ſelves that we are truly juſtified; as theſe upſtart patritians do hold: but it is the condition of the covenant of grace. Every covenant hath its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed; and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the book of the covenant,</hi> Exod. 24.7. <hi>the words of the covenant,</hi> Exod. 34.28. <hi>the tables of the covenant,</hi> Deut. 9.11. The reaſon is this; Becauſe when a covenant
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2082:143"/> is made, the conditions are put into a book or a table and expreſſed in words. Onely here is the difference between the firſt covenant of works and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond covenant of grace: Both have conditions; but here, I ſay, is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; In the one grace giveth the covenant, and grace giveth the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant; but a condition is annexed though: Now hence we may argue, (and none but enemies to the Goſpel can denie it) If the covenant of grace do bind a mans conſcience, then certainly the condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant bindeth a mans conſcience too: But the covenant of grace bindeth the conſcience of the regenerate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the condition of it bindeth. If you ask, What is this to obedience? the anſwer is, That obedience is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant of grace, as the forenamed Scripture expreſſeth, Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2082:144"/> we may learn, that no creature can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with it, nor free conſcience from guilt when a man tranſgreſſeth the word. What a damned uſurpation is it in the Pope to offer to diſpenſe?

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2082:144"/> one tittle of the word from binding conſcience. Doth the word ſay thus or thus? thou hadſt beſt do it: If thou wilt not, all the whole world cannot help thee; thy conſcience will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee at the day of judgement without remedie.

Ye may ſee the power of Gods word in that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. 18.18. That is, My word which ye preach is of that nature, that if that looſe your conſcience, it is looſed indeed, and nothing can bind it; if that do bind it, it is bound ſoundly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2082:145"/> indeed, and nothing can looſe it. O this is a terrour to the wicked! Doth the word of God ſay,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>He that hardneth his neck, being often rebuked, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured?</hi> O fear and tremble ye that harden your necks againſt the reproofs of the Almightie: his word bindeth over your conſciences to Chriſts barre. Doth the word ſay <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge?</hi> If thou beeſt ſuch an one, thy conſcience is bound with this word, and it will apply it to the ſoul before the tribunal-ſeat of Chriſt. Doth the word crie out againſt any of thy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? thy conſcience is bound as with chains, and it is not all thy vain hopes and excuſes can looſe thee. Again, this is comfort to the godly: Gods word is the ſupreme binder of conſcience. O ye bleſſed of the Lord, the word of God tieth ſuch a faſt knot to your comforts that all hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open it with their teeth: The word of the Lord Jeſus is with your, <hi>who hath the key of David, that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no

                  <p>YE have heard that the bonds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are of two ſorts: Firſt, there is a ſupreme bond of conſcience, and that is Gods word: of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken. Secondly, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative bond of conſcience, which bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth conſcience indeed, but it is onely in relation to Gods word, becauſe Gods word putteth authority upon it. And this latter is alſo of two ſorts: 1. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may bind conſcience; 2. We our ſelves may bind our own conſciences.</p>
                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>I. Others may bind our conſciences.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. Others may bind our conſciences, namely, when they have authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them from God, &amp; ſo their laws and commands receive vigour and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:2082:146"/> force from Gods laws. Thus the laws and commands of Magiſtrates bind the conſcience of People; of Parents bind the conſcience of Children; of Maſters bind the conſcience of Servants: For though they do not bind conſcience as they are the commandments of men, yet having Gods ſeal and authority upon them they do. I will ſet down ſome concluſions whereby ye may know how farre the laws and commandments of others bind or not bind conſcience.</p>

That chapter doth moſt clearly prove this concluſion unto us.</p>
                        <p>Out of the firſt part of the chapter we learn, 1. That Magiſtrates have power and authority to make laws, and to eſtabliſh orders among men; and therefore they are called <hi>powers:</hi> 2. We learn that theſe laws of Magiſtrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2082:147"/> ſtrength and force from the law of God: <hi>For the powers that be are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God,</hi> ſaith the text. 3. Thoſe laws made by the Magiſtrate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by God have power to bind conſcience, verſ. 5. <hi>Wherefore we muſt be ſubject not onely becauſe of wrath but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> And the violating of them is ſinne. When their authority is confirmed by God, we cannot <hi>reſiſt them</hi> but we <hi>reſiſt the ordinance of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: nay, we may <hi>pull condemnation upon us</hi> if we do; <hi>They that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> verſ. 2. So that this firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion telleth us what laws of men are to be obeyed; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Such as do vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually flow from Gods word, though not expreſſely commanded in it; 2. Such as are good and wholeſome and profitable for the common-wealth: Theſe though they are not particularly commanded in Gods word, yet are they by virtue of it injoyned: and therefore to neglect them and be diſobedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, is to neglect and be diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to God. Again, ſo farre onely are
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2082:147"/> they to be obeyed (ſo farre onely, I ſay) as they virtually do flow from Gods word: for ſo farre onely they receive force from Gods law. This is the firſt concluſion.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. When they command that which though in it ſelf it be not ſimply and abſolutely ſinfull and unlawfull, yet it doth put us upon a neceſſity of ſinning: As for example, If a Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſingle life to all Miniſters, this thing is not in it ſelf ſimply unlawfull, (for it is lawfull to marry, and it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to marry) yet this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is unlawfull, becauſe it would put Miniſters upon a neceſſity of ſinning: The reaſon is, becauſe all have not this power. And therefore ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment as this would not bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: For the conſcience cannot be bound to impurity, or an apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2082:148"/> of impurity: and therefore though the thing be not ſimply unlawfull, yet the commandment is ſimply unlawfull, and doth not bind conſcience. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle maketh ſuch a commandment to argue a ſeared conſcience in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: and therefore none but a ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience can think it is bound by it, 1. Tim. 4.2, 3.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The commandments of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates loſe their power of binding the conſcience when they command things that are unlawfull in themſelves and contrary to the word of God. In this caſe they do not bind conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods ſeal is not on them. We have an example of this in the three bleſſed children;<note place="margin">

So alſo Daniel, when he was commanded not to ask any petition of God for thirty dayes ſpace, but onely of the king, Daniel did not conceive himſelf bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2082:148"/> nay he choſe rather to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the den of lions then obey.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.16.</note> In this caſe the anſwer of the Apoſtles is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie; who when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to preach any more in the name of the Lord Jeſus, thus they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to obey men rather then God, judge ye.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. When mens laws and commands overthrow the libertie of Chriſtianitie, that Chriſtian libertie which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, then they loſe their power of binding the conſcience. But here I muſt tell you of a caution; <hi>viz.</hi> That this libertie may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a double reſpect: 1. In regard of it ſelf, the libertie it ſelf; 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the exerciſe or uſe of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Now there is a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe two conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a mans having a ſword and a mans wearing a ſword. The Magiſtrate may reſtrain a man from wearing a ſword at ſuch or ſuch a time, though he do not take his ſword from him: ſo
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2082:149"/> there is difference between the having our libertie and the uſing our libertie. There is a libertie purchaſed for Gods children, whereby all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lawfull unto them: <hi>All things are lawfull unto me,</hi> ſaith Paul 1. Cor. 6.12. <hi>and there is nothing evil in it ſelf:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14.</note> (he ſpeaketh of indifferent things.) Gods children are freed from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of meats, and drinks, and times, and garments. Now whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commandment is made by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate contrarie to this libertie doth not bind conſcience: for nothing can bind conſcience when Chriſt doth looſe it: Yet there may be a reſtraint of the uſe of this libertie: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Magiſtrate may command us to forbear ſome kinds of meats at ſome certain times; and ſo alſo for garments, and the like: namely, when the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine about meats and drinks and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is pure. And therefore in ſuch a caſe the command of the Magiſtrate bindeth the conſcience; otherwiſe not.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. When they command things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to be abſolutely neceſſarie, to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2082:149"/> make them idolatrous or ſuperſtitious, then in this caſe they are unlawfull and bind not the conſcience to obey them. But when are they idolatrous?

This comforteth Gods people againſt the calumnies and ſlanders of wicked and ungodly men that upbraid them for their obedience to God. O ſay they, <hi>Ye are irregular and deſpiſers of authoritie.</hi> I ſay, this is comfort to the godly, that God is able to bear them out in obeying him rather then men. Gods word is the ſupreme binder of conſcience; and therefore, whatever men think of ſuch, they are abſolutely bound to obey God. If men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us againſt the word of God, we know their authoritie is the ordinance
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2082:154"/> of God; and therefore if they go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, they do not bind us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If God had not bound us in conſcience to him, others might have taken it ill if we ſhould not obey them: but now what cauſe have others to think ill of us? What folly were it in us to ſeek to pleaſe men and to diſpleaſe God? If we were at libertie, then we might chooſe whom we would obey: but now we are bound unto God, and muſt be obedient unto God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men command to the contrarie, let us do it therefore with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. By this we ſhew our ſubmiſſion to God; by this we ſatisfie conſcience, which being bound unto God doth continually urge us to obey him. Why ſhould we omit part of the exactneſſe of our obedience which the word of God doth require? We have more to do then ever we ſhall be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: we ſhould therefore be carefull to do all that we may. By our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God in this kind we convince the conſcience of others of our up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe towards God: Though
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2082:154"/> through the overruling dominion of their luſts and paſſions they rage at us, and their mouthes ſpeak evil of us, yet we may have an evidence in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences within which may teſtifie for us: their conſciences will whiſper within them, <hi>Surely they do well to pleaſe God rather then men:</hi> their conſciences will be on our ſide, though their actions and tongues be againſt us. We have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example of this Acts 4.15, 16. When the rulers of the Jews had threatned the Apoſtles, and had reviled them with many bitter words, and had bidden them go aſide for a while, then they concluded among themſelves, <hi>Surely an evident ſigne is done by them, and we cannot deny it:</hi> So that their conſciences acquitted them for good men. So when the wicked of this world have ſpoken evil of the wayes of the righteous, and blaſphemed the holy name after which they are named; yet when they are alone, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at counſel within themſelves, then they conclude, <hi>Indeed they do well.</hi> Thus their conſciences give a good
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2082:155"/> evidence of us, and accuſe them for not doing the like. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of other mens bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of conſcience.</p>

Baptiſme is a very great binder of conſcience: It bindeth a man to believe, and to go out of himſelf, and to ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt. The wicked Phariſees ſaw this to be true:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25.</note> 
                        <hi>If we ſhall ſay that Johns baptiſme was from heaven, he will ſay, Why did ye not then believe?</hi> Beloved, was not your baptiſme from heaven? was it not an ordinance of God? and did ye not ſolemnly then vow unto God? Why then do ye not believe? why do ye not denie your ſelves, your works, your wayes, and take up Chriſts croſſe? As Chriſt ſaith of John Baptiſt, <hi>Among them that are born of women there hath not been a greater then John the Baptiſt;</hi>

It is moſt certain, that Baptiſme doth greatly bind us in conſcience to walk anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to it in all righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe: And we can never be ſaved (though we are baptized) except we can anſwer with a good conſcience that we live as we vowed in our Baptiſme: 1.
